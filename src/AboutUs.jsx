                DJ CodeStars is a not-for-profit educational initiative by 
                D.J. Sanghvi College Of Engineering. It is a programming community that 
                fosters learning and friendly competition. DJ CodeStars was created as a platform to help 
                programmers make it big in the world of data structures, mathematics, algorithms, computer 
                programming, and programming contests.

                We host contests every month and give away prizes and goodies to the winners as encouragement. 
                We also regularly conduct lectures focused on Data Structures and Algorithms for the students of 
                D.J. Sanghvi College.
